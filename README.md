# Cancer-Prediction

Dataset Information:

Target Variable (y):

Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
Ten features (X) are computed for each cell nucleus:

radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
perimeter
area
smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
symmetry
fractal dimension (coastline approximation - 1)

For each characteristic three measures are given:
a. Mean
b. Standard error
c. Largest/ Wors
